Graph Algorithms by Rayhan Hossain (Mukla.C)
--------- In this Repo --------------------

1. Graph.java: It scans input from the input_print_graph.txt 
file, creates a graph, and prints the graph. To run, it requires 
two helper classes- Vertex.java and Neighbor.java which are also 
added in this repository. 

2. DFS- using Stack: DFS.java is the main class where I wrote a 
function named runDFS(). It uses other classes- Graph, Vertex, 
and Neighbor to create the graph. input_dfs.txt is used for 
the graph input.
